    <h1>About PAGE</h1>
	<p>The openLIBS website provides a convenient environment for the Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) data analysis to obtain qualitative information about the sample. The website uses the latest version of the <a href="https://github.com/Bluejee/OpenLIBS">OpenLIBS package</a> as a back end enabling direct and quick access for LIBS analysis.</p>

	<p>The team that made this work possible :<br>
