# LIBS_Analysis_Website

Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) is a versatile tool for quantitatively and qualitatively analysing a sample using laser ablation. It is a rapid and portable technique that requires no sample preparation. In LIBS the optical emissions from the plasma plume produced by the pulsed laser ablation of the sample surface are recorded and compared to a database of atomic emission spectra of known materials.

This website provides a convenient environment for the analysis of LIBS spectra to obtain qualitative information about the sample. The website uses the latest version of the [OpenLIBS package](https://github.com/Bluejee/OpenLIBS) enabling direct and quick access.
